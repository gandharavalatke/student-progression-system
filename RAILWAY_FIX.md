# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
- Health check failed on Railway
- Service unavailable errors
- Replica never became healthy

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Updated railway.json**
- Changed health check path to `/api/health`
- Increased timeout to 300 seconds
- Added proper health check configuration

### 2. **Added Health Check Endpoints**
- Added `/` endpoint for basic health check
- Added `/api/health` endpoint for Railway health monitoring
- Both return JSON status responses

### 3. **Updated Flask Configuration**
- Added proper health check routes
- Configured for Railway deployment

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Step 1: Update GitHub**
1. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway health check issues"
   git push origin master
   ```

### **Step 2: Redeploy on Railway**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" or "Deploy" button
3. Railway will use the updated configuration

### **Step 3: Monitor Deployment**
1. Check the "Deploy Logs" tab
2. Look for successful health check messages
3. Verify the app starts without errors

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### **Successful Deployment:**
- ✅ "Health check passed"
- ✅ "Service is healthy"
- ✅ "Deployment successful"

### **If Still Failing:**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Check SendGrid API key is valid

## 📞 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Environment Variables Missing**
   - Check all variables are set in Railway dashboard
   - Verify MongoDB URI is correct
   - Confirm SendGrid API key is valid

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows Railway IPs
   - Check connection string format

3. **Port Configuration**
   - Railway automatically sets PORT environment variable
   - Flask app uses `os.environ.get('PORT', 5001)`

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
After applying these fixes, your deployment should succeed and you'll get a working URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

The health check will return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Student Progression System is running"
}
```
